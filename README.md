Welcome to my 100 Days of DSA challenge using C++!  
This repository contains my daily progress as I work through the *"Decode DSA with C++"* course by *PW Skills*.

## Why this Challenge?
I'm committed to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with C++ to strengthen my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.


- *Goal*: 100 days of consistent coding and learning

## Repository Structure
Each day has its own folder containing:
- main.cpp — My C++ code and solutions
- notes.md — Key concepts, doubts, and explanations from that day


## How to Use
Feel free to explore the folders if you're doing a similar course or challenge. You can fork this repo and start your own journey too!
